# NISTADS-adsorption-prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to delve into the fascinating world of adsorption, a surface-based process where a film of particles (adsorbate) accumulate on the surface of a material (adsorbent). This phenomenon is used across various industries, including water purification, air filtration, and in catalytic converters in automobiles.

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to harness the power of machine learning to predict the adsorption of chemicals on adsorbent materials. The aim is to build a model that can accurately predict the adsorbed amount of a specific guest-host combination under various conditions, by leveraging the data from the NIST/ARPA-E Database. This could have significant implications for industries that rely on these materials, potentially leading to more efficient processes and better materials design.

## Data source
The NIST/ARPA-E Database of Novel and Emerging Adsorbent Materials is a free, web-based catalog of adsorbent materials and measured adsorption properties of numerous materials obtained from article entries from the scientific literature. Search fields for the database include adsorbent material, adsorbate gas, experimental conditions (pressure, temperature), and bibliographic information (author, title, journal), and results from queries are provided as a list of articles matching the search parameters. The database also contains adsorption isotherms digitized from the cataloged articles, which can be compared visually online in the web application or exported for offline analytics.
